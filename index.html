  <p>We here at Vicious Cycles believe that no two bikes should be the same. Unless of course you have a twin and just HAVE to look like each other. In any event, we strive to customize your bike based on your needs, goals, and most importantly, your style. People strive to have a unique look and we feel like your bike should be an extension of that. But don't think our bikes are made just for the red carpet. Our bikes are built to last and we have an amazing staff ready to go in our shop should you take it to the extreme.</p>
  <p>This is another test. Don't worry, it is only a test.</p>
